        "description": "The world of work is in a state of flux the likes of which we have not seen in decades. Many of the fundamental assumptions about work and employment are being revisited, reshaped, and renegotiated.",
        "details": "At the heart of this turbulent era is a shift in expectations between employees and their employers—expectations about where work is performed, how it is performed, and the exchange for worker effort.",
        "purpose": "During periods of change like this one, rich data is needed to capture emerging patterns and trends, helping paint a portrait of new realities at work. Korn Ferry's research aims to better understand perceptions, attitudes, and expectations about work, documenting important dynamics that should inform how we think about the world of work today."
