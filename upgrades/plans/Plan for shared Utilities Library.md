# Plan for Shared Utilities Library and Modularization

## Completed ✅

- Created shared utilities directory at /utils/shared
- Extracted CORS and preflight handling into utils/shared/cors.js
- Created shared logger helpers in utils/shared/loggerHelpers.js
- Refactored app/api/chat-assistant/route.ts to use shared logger helpers
- Refactored utils/openai/retrieval.js to use shared logger helpers
- Extracted error handling and response formatting into utils/shared/errorHandler.js
- Refactored app/api/chat-assistant/route.ts to use shared error handler
- Extracted helper utilities (e.g., sanitizeOutput, isJsonContent) into utils/shared/utils.js
- Refactored app/api/chat-assistant/route.ts to use shared helper utilities

## Remaining 🛠️

- Extract polling logic (e.g., waitForNoActiveRuns) into utils/shared/polling.js
- Refactor route handlers to use shared errorHandler, utils, and polling modules
- Abstract core business logic into service classes or functions in /services or /lib
- Consolidate similar route handlers (e.g., POST and PUT) to share common controller logic
- Add or update unit and integration tests for shared modules and refactored routes
- Validate logging, error handling, and polling behavior after refactoring

## Benefits 🌟

- Improved maintainability and consistency
- Centralized performance-sensitive code for easier optimization
- Reduced code duplication and improved readability
- Simplified testing and future enhancements
