# Repository Pattern Implementation Backlog

**Last Updated:** Sat May 25 2025

## Overview

This document tracks outstanding work items, technical debt, and future improvements for the repository pattern implementation. Items are prioritized based on their impact and dependencies.

## High Priority Items

### 1. Improve Query Intent Classification

**Problem:** The current implementation relies on brittle hard-coded regex patterns for query intent detection, which will miss many valid phrasings and lacks semantic understanding.

**Solution:** Replace pattern matching with prompt-based intent classification.

**Tasks:**

- Create a `PromptService` interface to abstract LLM interactions
- Modify QueryProcessor to use the prompt for intent classification
- Maintain patterns as fallbacks only
- Add unit tests comparing pattern-based vs. prompt-based classification
- Update adapter to properly integrate with prompt system

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- Intent classification correctly identifies > 95% of comparison queries in test set
- Classification includes confidence scores for each detected intent
- System gracefully handles ambiguous queries with multiple possible intents

**Source:** Created directly in backlog, based on implementation concerns

**Status:** ðŸŸ  Not Started - Depends on adapter implementation
