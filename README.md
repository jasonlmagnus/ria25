## Workforce 2025 RIA Survey Tool Details

Interactive assistant for exploring the 2025 Workforce Survey data.

_Updated: April 7, 2024 - Latest deployment with streaming improvements_
_(Note: This timestamp should be updated as per the "Documentation Timestamp Standard")_

### Operation Modes

The application can run in two different modes for handling survey data:

#### 1. Standard Mode (`npm run dev`)

- Uses `FILE_ACCESS_MODE=standard`
- Data is sent along with each request to the assistant
- Better for testing and development
- Requires more bandwidth due to data transfer

#### 2. Light Mode (`npm run dev:light`)

- Uses `FILE_ACCESS_MODE=direct`
- Assistant retrieves data directly from files
- More efficient for production use
- Requires proper data file setup in `scripts/data/` directory

### Data File Requirements

For the assistant to work properly, ensure these files are present:

- `scripts/data/2024/2024_global_data.csv`
- `scripts/data/2025/2025_global_data.csv`

## Data Processing Scripts ðŸ“Š

The project includes scripts for processing survey data located in the `scripts/` directory:

### Data Processing Workflow

1. **Initial Setup**

   - Place 2024 data in `scripts/data/2024/2024_global_data.csv`
   - Place 2025 data in `scripts/data/2025/2025_global_data.csv`

2. **Processing Script**
   `process_survey_data.js` handles data transformation:

   - Converts CSV to JSON format
   - Harmonizes data between years
   - Splits into individual question files
   - Adds metadata and categorization

3. **Running the Processing**

   ```bash
   # Process 2024 data
   node process_survey_data.js --year=2024

   # Process 2025 data
   node process_survey_data.js --year=2025
   ```

### Directory Structure

```
scripts/
â”œâ”€â”€ data/                           # Survey data files
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ 2024/                      # 2024 survey data
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ 2024_global_data.csv   # Global dataset for 2024
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ 2025/                      # 2025 survey data
â”‚       â””â”€â”€ 2025_global_data.csv   # Global dataset for 2025
â””â”€â”€ output/                         # Generated JSON files
    â””â”€â”€ split_data/                # Individual question files
```
