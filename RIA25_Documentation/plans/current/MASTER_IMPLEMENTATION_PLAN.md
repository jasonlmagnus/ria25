## Current Issues

The current implementation has identified these key issues that need immediate attention:

1. **OpenAI Migration Monitoring**: The monitoring dashboard for OpenAI migration shows 0 calls because the feature flags `USE_RESPONSES_API` and `UNIFIED_OPENAI_SERVICE` are disabled. This needs to be enabled to properly track migration metrics.

2. **Follow-up Questions**: Fixed an issue where follow-up questions unconditionally used cached files without checking if the query topic had changed. The fix adds semantic analysis to detect topic changes.

3. **Testing Issues**: Final test execution issues with mock response formats need resolution to complete the OpenAI service unification testing.
