Implementation Plan
Phase 1: Interface Definition (1 day)
Create TypeScript interfaces based on existing JSDoc types
Ensure compatibility with existing implementation
Phase 2: Code Conversion (1 day)
Convert smart_filtering.js to TypeScript
Update import/export statements to use new interfaces
Phase 3: Testing (1 day)
Create comprehensive test suite
Test edge cases and error handling
Phase 4: Documentation (0.5 day)
Document interfaces and filtering capabilities
Add usage examples
The highest priority is formalizing the interfaces as this provides the foundation for the remaining work.
