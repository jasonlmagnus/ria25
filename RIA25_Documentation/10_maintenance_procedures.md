# RIA25 Maintenance Procedures

## Overview

This document outlines the maintenance procedures, update processes, and troubleshooting guidelines for the RIA25 system. It serves as a reference for ongoing maintenance and support activities.

## Suggested Maintenance Tasks

### Regular System Check

Key tasks to maintain system health:

- Monitor system logs and error reports
- Review OpenAI API usage and costs
- Check response times periodically

## Periodic Review

Recommended reviews on a regular basis:

- Analyze and categorize any system errors
- Review query patterns and system utilization
- Verify data accessibility and functionality

## Ongoing Improvements

Areas for continuous improvement:

- Review and refine system prompts based on usage
- Audit system security and access controls
- Update documentation as needed
- Verify backup procedures

## Update Procedures

### Survey Data Updates

When new survey data becomes available:

1. **Data Preparation**

   - Validate new CSV data format
   - Ensure consistent column structure with existing data
   - Place file in `/2025_DATA_PROCESSING/` directory

2. **Processing Script Execution**

   ```bash
   cd scripts
   node process_survey_data.js --input="../2025_DATA_PROCESSING/new_data.csv" --output="./output/split_data/"
   ```

3. **Output Verification**

   - Verify all expected JSON files are generated
   - Check JSON structure consistency
   - Validate metadata accuracy

4. **Data Integration**

   - Once JSON files are validated, they need to be integrated with the system
   - This would require updating any data references or configurations

5. **System Testing**
   - Test queries specific to new data
   - Verify retrieval accuracy
   - Check cross-referencing with existing data

### Prompt System Updates (Recommended Process)

When updating the system prompt:

1. **Prompt Development**

   - Draft updated prompt version
   - Document changes and rationale

2. **Test Environment Setup**

   - Create test assistant with new prompt
   - Maintain existing assistant during testing

3. **Testing**

   - Execute standard test scenarios
   - Test edge cases
   - Compare results with previous prompt version

4. **Deployment**

   - Update production assistant with new prompt
   - Document prompt version change
   - Monitor initial responses for quality

5. **Rollback Procedure**
   - If issues are detected, revert to previous prompt version
   - Document issues for further refinement

### Web Interface Updates

When updating the Next.js application:

1. **Development**

   - Implement changes in development environment
   - Test functionality thoroughly

2. **Staging Deployment**

   - Deploy to staging environment
   - Conduct user acceptance testing

3. **Production Deployment**

   ```bash
   git push vercel main
   ```

4. **Post-Deployment Verification**
   - Verify all features function correctly
   - Check mobile and desktop compatibility
   - Validate API integration

## Suggested Backup Procedures

### Data Backup

1. **Export Assistant Configuration**

   - Document assistant ID and configuration settings
   - Store configuration information securely

2. **JSON Data Backup**

   - Maintain copies of all processed JSON files
   - Store original CSV data securely
   - Document backup locations

3. **Recommended Backup Schedule**

   - Configuration documentation: When changed
   - JSON data backup: After processing
   - Code repository backup: Regular intervals

4. **Backup Storage Recommendations**

   - Primary: Secure cloud storage
   - Secondary: Local storage
   - Consider encryption for sensitive data

## Troubleshooting

### Suggested Diagnostic Approaches

#### API Connectivity Issues

1. Verify API key validity and environment variable configuration
2. Check API status at OpenAI status page
3. Test basic API connectivity with curl command
4. Review API response logs for error messages

#### Data Retrieval Issues

1. Verify assistant configuration
2. Check file accessibility and integrity
3. Validate data formats and structures
4. Review retrieval mechanisms

#### Response Quality Issues

1. Analyze prompt configuration
2. Test with simplified queries
3. Review context being provided to the model
4. Check for changes in underlying data

## Monitoring Recommendations

### Performance Monitoring

- **Response Time**: Consider tracking average and peak response times
- **API Usage**: Monitor token consumption and request volume
- **Error Rate**: Track frequency and types of errors

### Usage Monitoring

- **Query Patterns**: Review common query types
- **User Sessions**: Consider monitoring session activity
- **Feature Utilization**: Note which capabilities are most used

### Potential Alert Thresholds

Consider setting up alerts for:

- Extended response times (e.g., >15 seconds average)
- Elevated error rates (e.g., >5% of requests)
- High API usage (e.g., >80% of quota)
- Any system downtime

## System Recovery Guidelines

### Critical Failure Recovery

1. **Assessment**

   - Identify failure point
   - Determine impact scope
   - Establish recovery priority

2. **Containment**

   - Limit system access if necessary
   - Implement temporary workarounds
   - Communicate status to stakeholders

3. **Recovery Steps**

   - Restore data if corruption occurred
   - Redeploy application if web interface failed
   - Reconfigure API connections if integration issues

4. **Verification**

   - Test system functionality
   - Verify data integrity
   - Confirm normal operation

5. **Documentation**
   - Record incident details
   - Document recovery process
   - Update procedures based on lessons learned

## Contact Roles

Key roles for system maintenance and support:

- System Administrator: Responsible for day-to-day maintenance
- Developer: Handles technical issues and code updates
- Prompt Engineer: Manages prompt system refinements
- Project Manager: Coordinates overall system management
