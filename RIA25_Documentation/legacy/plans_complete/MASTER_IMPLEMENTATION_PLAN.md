# RIA25 Master Implementation Plan

**Last Updated:** Mon May 6 11:15:36 BST 2025

## Executive Summary

This Master Implementation Plan consolidates all project documentation into a single source of truth for the RIA25 project, focusing on:

1. **Repository Pattern Implementation** (95% Complete)
2. **OpenAI Responses API Migration** (95% Complete)
3. **Smart Filtering Integration** (100% Complete)
4. **Testing Infrastructure** (95% Complete)
5. **Compatibility Enhancements** (0% Complete)

The project is progressing well with all critical components now operational. The adapter layer is at 85% completion, and current efforts are focused on finalizing integration tests and enhancing monitoring.

## Current Issues

The current implementation has identified these key issues that need immediate attention:

1. **OpenAI Migration Monitoring**: The monitoring dashboard for OpenAI migration shows 0 calls because the feature flags `USE_RESPONSES_API` and `UNIFIED_OPENAI_SERVICE` are disabled. This needs to be enabled to properly track migration metrics.

2. **Follow-up Questions**: Fixed an issue where follow-up questions unconditionally used cached files without checking if the query topic had changed. The fix adds semantic analysis to detect topic changes.

3. **Testing Issues**: Final test execution issues with mock response formats need resolution to complete the OpenAI service unification testing.

4. **File Identification Path**: ‚úÖ **RESOLVED**: Implemented PromptRepository that delegates to the canonical 1_data_retrieval.md prompt path and removed crude keyword-matching from FileSystemRepository.

5. **Smart Filtering Implementation**: ‚úÖ **RESOLVED**: Completed implementation of SmartFilteringProcessor with full TypeScript interfaces, comprehensive tests, and documentation.

6. **Compatibility Data Loading**: Logs show issues with loading compatibility data, with errors indicating "fileCompatibilityData loaded but fileCompatibility object is empty or missing!" This needs investigation as it may impact the compatibility checking functionality.
