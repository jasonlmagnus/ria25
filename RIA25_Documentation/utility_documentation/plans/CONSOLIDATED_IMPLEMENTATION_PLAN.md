## Current Issues

The current implementation has identified these key issues that need immediate attention:

1. **OpenAI Migration Monitoring**: The monitoring dashboard for OpenAI migration shows 0 calls because the feature flags `USE_RESPONSES_API` and `UNIFIED_OPENAI_SERVICE` are disabled. This needs to be enabled to properly track migration metrics.

2. **Follow-up Questions**: Fixed an issue where follow-up questions unconditionally used cached files without checking if the query topic had changed. The fix adds semantic analysis to detect topic changes.

3. **Testing Issues**: Final test execution issues with mock response formats need resolution to complete the OpenAI service unification testing.

## Critical Path to Completion

The following tasks are on the critical path and must be completed in this order:

1. Complete testing for OpenAI service unification and verify mocks
2. Complete adapter integration tests for the repository pattern
3. Implement smart filtering integration
4. Complete monitoring and alerting infrastructure
5. Begin phased rollout with feature flags

2. **Integration Tests**: Testing interactions between components
3. **Shadow Tests**: Comparing new and legacy implementations
4. **E2E Tests**: Verifying complete user flows

The current focus is on completing integration tests for adapters and fixing mock response formats for OpenAI tests.

## Rollout Plan

The rollout will use a phased approach with feature flags:

1. **Phase 1: Shadow Mode** (Completed)

   - Run both implementations side-by-side for comparison
   - No user-visible changes

2. **Phase 2: Limited Rollout** (Completed)

   - Enable repository pattern for 5-25% of traffic
   - Monitor for issues

3. **Phase 3: Combined Adapter Rollout** (In Progress)

   - Enable service adapter alongside retrieval adapter
   - Increase to 50% traffic if stable

4. **Phase 4: Full Rollout** (Scheduled)

   - Enable for 100% of traffic
   - Continue monitoring for 1 week

5. **Phase 5: Code Cleanup** (80% Complete)
   - Remove fallback code
   - Clean up deprecated implementations
   - Remove feature flags

## Risk Analysis
