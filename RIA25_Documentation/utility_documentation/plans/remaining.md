# Remaining Tasks Before OpenAI Responses API Migration

Looking at the migration plan and current status, here are the critical tasks that must be completed before safely enabling the Responses API feature flag:

## 1. Complete OpenAI Service Unification (95% Complete)

**Progress Update (May 29, 2023):**

- ✅ Enhanced error handling implementation with type-specific recovery strategies
- ✅ Improved timeout protection with AbortController support
- ✅ Added detailed logging and monitoring
- ✅ Implemented fallback mechanisms for all error types
- ✅ Created test data structure in tests/data
- ⏳ Test execution still needs debugging
- ⏳ Documentation created in RIA25_Documentation but needs review

**Remaining work:**

- Fix test execution issues
- Complete final review of documentation
- Conduct peer review of error handling implementation

## 2. Implement Controller Integration (80% Complete)

**Progress Update (May 29, 2023):**

- ✅ Implemented openaiController.ts with full unified service integration
- ✅ Modified DataRetrievalService to use unifiedOpenAIService
- ✅ Improved error handling in queryController.ts
- ✅ Fixed cache format issues in DataRetrievalService.updateThreadCache
- ⏳ retrieveDataController.ts still needs updating

**Remaining work:**

- Complete integration in retrieveDataController.ts
- Add monitoring metrics dashboard for tracking API calls
- Conduct integration tests across all controllers

## 3. Resolve Adapter Layer Implementation (Not Started)

**Remaining work:**

- Complete adapter layers connecting repository pattern to unified service
- Implement feature flags for controlled rollout of adapters
- Add comprehensive logging for adapter operations

## 4. Implement Comprehensive Test Suite (20% Started)

**Progress Update (May 29, 2023):**

- ✅ Created test structure for unifiedOpenAIService
- ✅ Implemented test data directory organization

**Remaining work:**

- Create unit tests for all components
- Develop integration tests for critical paths
- Test streaming behavior with various outputs
- Verify error handling across different scenarios
- Implement automated regression testing

## 5. Finalize Performance Benchmarking (60% Complete)

**Remaining work:**

- Run comprehensive benchmarks comparing original vs. Responses API
- Document performance characteristics
- Create performance regression tests
- Establish acceptable performance thresholds

## 6. Implement Phased Rollout Strategy (40% Complete)

**Remaining work:**

- Create detailed activation schedule for feature flags
- Document complete rollback procedures
- Create monitoring dashboard for rollout health
- Prepare user communication for any potential impacts

## Next Steps (Prioritized)

1. **Fix Cache Integration Issues**

   - Test the fixes for thread cache data format
   - Address any additional cache format issues in other controllers

2. **Complete Task 2: Controller Integration**

   - Complete retrieveDataController.ts integration
   - Add monitoring across all controllers
   - Test entire controller flow

3. **Expand Task 4: Test Suite Implementation**

   - Create comprehensive test cases for unified OpenAI service
   - Develop integration tests for critical paths

4. **Continue Task 5: Performance Benchmarking**
   - Conduct comparison testing between original and Responses API
   - Document performance characteristics
