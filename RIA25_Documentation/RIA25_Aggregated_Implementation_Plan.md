  └── [additional controllers]
  ```

- Create service directory structure:

  ```
  app/api/services/
  ├── threadService.js
  ├── dataRetrievalService.js
  ├── openaiService.js
  └── [additional services]
  ```

- Refactor key API routes:
  1. `app/api/chat-assistant/route.ts` → Use `chatAssistantController`
  2. `app/api/query/route.js` → Use `queryController`
  3. `app/api/retrieve-data/route.js` → Use `retrieveDataController`

**Shared Utilities Library**

- Create standardized utilities:

- Create `utils/data/incremental_cache.js`:
  1. Calculate missing data scope
  2. Merge new segments with existing data
  3. Optimize loading based on query needs

**Key Deliverables:**

- Enhanced smart filtering with segment awareness
- Thread-specific caching with segment tracking
- Reduced data loading for follow-up queries
