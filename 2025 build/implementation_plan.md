# Implementation Plan: 2025 Global Workforce Survey AI Assistant

## Overview

This document outlines the comprehensive implementation plan for building the 2025 Global Workforce Survey AI Assistant. The assistant will provide insights from the 2025 survey data and enable year-over-year comparisons with the 2024 survey where applicable.

## Implementation Steps

### 1. Data Preparation

#### 1.1 Process Survey CSV Files

- Execute existing data processing pipeline to convert raw CSV data into JSON format
- Ensure all demographic columns are properly mapped
- Validate data integrity and structure

#### 1.2 Prepare Vector Store Documents

- Run `prepare_vector_data.js` to create vector-optimized documents
- Generate separate documents for:
  - Survey data (2025)
  - Comparison data (2024 vs 2025)
  - Reference information
- Ensure documents are formatted for efficient retrieval by OpenAI's vector store

#### 1.3 Create Question Mapping

- Run `create_question_mapping.js` to generate mappings between question IDs and full question text
- Validate mapping coverage and accuracy
- Create simplified reference mapping for ease of use

### 2. System Configuration

#### 2.1 Create System Prompt

- Use `system_prompt_2025.json` as the foundation
- Customize with specific survey information
- Define rules for:
  - Data access and presentation
  - Year-over-year comparisons
  - Response formatting
  - Prohibited topics and actions

#### 2.2 Configure OpenAI Assistant

- Create new assistant using the OpenAI API
- Apply configuration from `assistant_config.json`
- Upload prepared files to the assistant:
  - Vector documents
  - Reference guide
  - Question mapping
  - Comparable data index

#### 2.3 Set Up API Endpoints

- Implement API routes in the Next.js application
- Create handler for sending messages to the assistant
- Implement streaming response functionality
- Set up proper error handling and response formatting

#### 2.4 Create UI Components

- Update frontend components to handle assistant responses
- Implement comparison view components
- Create loading states and error handling UI
- Add support for conversation history

### 3. Integration with Frontend

#### 3.1 Update API Routes

- Integrate OpenAI Assistant API with existing routes
- Implement authentication and session management
- Set up rate limiting and usage tracking

#### 3.2 Update UI Components

- Modify existing UI to display year-over-year comparisons
- Create new visualization components for trending data
- Implement topic filtering and navigation
- Update mobile responsive design

## Implementation Timeline

### Week 1: Data Preparation

- Process all 2025 survey data
- Create vector documents
- Generate question mappings
- Test data integrity

### Week 2: System Configuration

- Finalize system prompt
- Configure OpenAI assistant
- Upload prepared files
- Initial testing of assistant capabilities

### Week 3: Frontend Integration

- Implement API routes
- Create/update UI components
- Test end-to-end functionality
- Gather feedback from beta testers

### Week 4: Refinement and Launch

- Production deployment

## Success Criteria

1. **Accuracy**: The assistant accurately provides data from the 2025 Global Workforce Survey.
2. **Comparability**: Year-over-year comparisons are valid and appropriately handled.
3. **Robustness**: The assistant handles a wide range of queries including complex, multi-part questions.
4. **Relevance**: Responses are relevant to the user's query and provide meaningful insights.
5. **Performance**: Response times are acceptable (typically under 10 seconds).
6. **Usability**: The interface is intuitive and the responses are well-formatted and easy to understand.
7. **Compatibility**: The assistant works across all supported devices and browsers.

## Additional Considerations

### Data Security

- Ensure all data handling complies with security requirements
- Implement appropriate access controls
- Monitor usage patterns for anomalies

### Performance Optimization

- Monitor response times and optimize as needed
- Consider caching common queries
- Optimize vector document structure for retrieval efficiency

### Future Enhancements

- Integration with data visualization tools
- Export functionality for insights
- Custom filtering options for specific user roles
- Support for additional languages

## Conclusion

This implementation plan provides a structured approach to building the 2025 Global Workforce Survey AI Assistant. By following these steps, the team will create a powerful tool that provides valuable insights from the survey data while enabling meaningful year-over-year comparisons with the 2024 survey.
